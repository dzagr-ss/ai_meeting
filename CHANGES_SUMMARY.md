# File Storage Structure Changes Summary

## Overview
Modified the meeting transcription system to organize audio files by username in addition to meeting ID, improving organization, security, and scalability.

## Changes Made

### 1. New File Storage Structure

**Before (Legacy):**
```
/tmp/
├── meeting_1_20240101_120000.wav
├── meeting_1_20240101_130000.wav
└── meeting_2_20240102_140000.wav
```

**After (New Structure):**
```
/tmp/meetings/
├── user_at_example_com/
│   ├── 1/
│   │   ├── meeting_1_20240101_120000.wav
│   │   └── meeting_1_20240101_130000.wav
│   └── 2/
│       └── meeting_2_20240102_140000.wav
└── another_user_at_domain_com/
    └── 3/
        └── meeting_3_20240103_150000.wav
```

### 2. Backend Changes (`backend/main.py`)

#### New Utility Functions
- `get_safe_email_for_path(email: str)` - Converts email to filesystem-safe format
- `migrate_existing_files(db: Session)` - Migrates files from old to new structure

#### Modified Functions
- `transcribe_meeting()` - Now creates user-specific directories and saves files there
- `get_meeting_audio_files()` - Updated to search in new structure with fallback migration
- `get_meeting_summary()` - Added user authentication and uses new file structure

#### New API Endpoints
- `POST /admin/migrate-files` - Manually trigger file migration
- `GET /admin/file-structure` - View current file organization for debugging

### 3. Key Features

#### Automatic Migration
- System automatically migrates files from old structure when accessed
- Fallback mechanism ensures backward compatibility
- Database lookup to determine file ownership during migration

#### Security Improvements
- User isolation: Each user's files stored in separate directories
- Authentication required for all file operations
- Users can only access their own meeting files

#### Email Sanitization
Converts email addresses to filesystem-safe format:
- `@` → `_at_`
- `.` → `_`
- `/` → `_`
- `\` → `_`

### 4. Testing

Created comprehensive test suite (`test_file_structure_simple.py`) that verifies:
- Email to safe path conversion
- Directory structure creation
- File storage and retrieval
- Migration functionality
- Various email format handling

### 5. Documentation Updates

Updated `README.md` with:
- New file storage structure documentation
- Migration instructions
- Security considerations
- API endpoint documentation

## Benefits

1. **User Isolation**: Each user's files are completely separated
2. **Better Organization**: Files grouped by user and meeting
3. **Enhanced Security**: Users cannot access other users' files
4. **Scalability**: Better performance with many users and meetings
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Automatic migration from old structure
6. **Debugging Support**: Admin endpoints for monitoring file structure

## Migration Path

1. **Automatic**: Files are migrated when accessed through the API
2. **Manual**: Use `POST /admin/migrate-files` endpoint
3. **Monitoring**: Use `GET /admin/file-structure` to view current state

## Production Considerations

1. Change storage location from `/tmp/` to persistent storage
2. Implement file cleanup policies
3. Add file size limits
4. Consider cloud storage for scalability
5. Restrict admin endpoints to authorized users only

## Testing Results

All tests passed successfully:
- ✓ Email sanitization works correctly
- ✓ Directory structure creation works
- ✓ File storage and retrieval works
- ✓ Migration functionality works
- ✓ Various email formats handled properly

## Bug Fixes

### Fixed NameError: 'get_current_user' not defined
**Issue**: The `get_current_user` function was being used in admin endpoints before it was defined, causing a `NameError` when starting the server.

**Solution**: Moved the `get_current_user` function definition to appear before the admin endpoints that depend on it.

**Files Changed**: `backend/main.py`
- Moved `get_current_user` function to line 145 (before admin endpoints)
- Removed duplicate function definition that appeared later in the file

**Verification**: 
- ✓ Server starts without errors
- ✓ API endpoints respond correctly
- ✓ All functionality preserved

### Fixed 401 Unauthorized Error in Summary Fetch
**Issue**: Frontend was getting 401 Unauthorized when fetching meeting summaries because the `fetchSummary` function wasn't including the authorization token in the request headers.

**Solution**: Added authorization header to the summary fetch request in the frontend.

**Files Changed**: `frontend/src/components/AudioRecorder.tsx`
- Added `Authorization: Bearer ${token}` header to the fetch request
- Added token validation before making the request
- Improved error handling for missing authentication

**Verification**: 
- ✓ Summary requests now include proper authentication
- ✓ 401 errors resolved
- ✓ Users can successfully fetch meeting summaries

## New Feature: Automatic Speaker Diarization Refinement

### Overview
Added automatic speaker diarization refinement that runs when a user stops recording. This feature uses all audio files from the meeting to perform comprehensive speaker analysis and updates existing transcriptions with improved speaker labels.

### Implementation Details

#### Backend Changes (`backend/main.py`)
- **New Endpoint**: `POST /meetings/{meeting_id}/refine-speakers` - Refines speaker diarization using all audio files
- **New Functions**:
  - `perform_comprehensive_speaker_analysis()` - Processes all audio files for comprehensive speaker analysis
  - `cluster_speakers_across_files()` - Clusters speakers across multiple files for consistent labeling
  - `update_transcriptions_with_refined_speakers()` - Updates existing transcriptions with refined speaker labels
  - `find_best_matching_segment()` - Matches transcriptions to refined segments using text similarity
  - `calculate_text_similarity()` - Calculates text similarity between transcription and segment text

#### Frontend Changes (`frontend/src/components/AudioRecorder.tsx`)
- **New Function**: `refineSpeakerDiarization()` - Calls the backend refinement endpoint
- **New State**: `isRefiningspeakers` - Tracks refinement process status
- **UI Enhancement**: Added "Refining Speakers" status chip during processing
- **Automatic Trigger**: Speaker refinement automatically runs after recording stops and audio upload completes

### How It Works

1. **Recording Stops**: User stops recording in the frontend
2. **Audio Upload**: Audio is uploaded to backend for transcription
3. **Automatic Refinement**: System automatically triggers speaker refinement
4. **Comprehensive Analysis**: Backend processes all audio files for the meeting
5. **Speaker Clustering**: Speakers are clustered across files for consistency
6. **Transcription Update**: Existing transcriptions are updated with refined speaker labels
7. **UI Feedback**: User sees "Refining Speakers" status during processing

### Benefits

- **Improved Accuracy**: Uses complete audio context for better speaker identification
- **Consistency**: Ensures consistent speaker labeling across all meeting segments
- **Automatic**: No user intervention required - happens automatically after recording
- **Non-Disruptive**: Runs in background without affecting user experience
- **Retroactive**: Updates previously generated transcriptions with better speaker labels

### Technical Features

- **Cross-File Analysis**: Analyzes all audio files from the meeting together
- **Text Similarity Matching**: Uses text similarity to match transcriptions with refined segments
- **Database Updates**: Safely updates existing transcription records
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with rollback on failures
- **Progress Tracking**: Logs processing progress and results

### API Response Example

```json
{
  "message": "Speaker diarization refined successfully",
  "audio_files_processed": 3,
  "transcriptions_updated": 15,
  "refined_segments": 18
}
```

### Future Enhancements

- Voice embedding-based clustering for more accurate speaker identification
- Real-time refinement during live transcription
- Speaker name assignment and persistence
- Confidence scoring for speaker assignments

## UI Refresh After Speaker Refinement

**Issue**: After speaker refinement completed successfully on the backend, the updated speaker labels were not immediately visible in the UI. Users had to manually reload the page to see the refined speaker names.

**Solution**: 
1. **Added Refresh Callback**: Extended `AudioRecorderProps` interface with optional `onTranscriptionsRefresh` callback
2. **Parent Component Integration**: Created `handleTranscriptionsRefresh` function in `MeetingRoom` component that reloads stored transcriptions from the backend
3. **Automatic Trigger**: Modified `refineSpeakerDiarization` function to call the refresh callback after successful speaker refinement
4. **Real-time Updates**: UI now automatically reflects updated speaker labels without requiring page reload

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/src/components/AudioRecorder.tsx`: Added `onTranscriptionsRefresh` prop and trigger logic
- `frontend/src/pages/MeetingRoom.tsx`: Added refresh callback function and passed it to AudioRecorder

**User Experience**: 
- Speaker refinement now provides immediate visual feedback
- Updated speaker labels (e.g., "SPEAKER_00" → "Speaker_1") appear automatically
- No manual page refresh required
- Maintains all existing functionality while improving responsiveness

## Audio Settings Popup UI Improvement

**Issue**: Audio Settings section took up significant vertical space in the meeting room interface, making the UI cluttered and reducing space for main content.

**Solution**:
1. **Moved to Popup**: Converted Audio Settings from a dedicated section to a popup window
2. **Top Right Button**: Added settings icon button in the top right corner of the header
3. **Enhanced UX**: Added tooltip, close button, device count indicator, and visual feedback for active device
4. **Space Optimization**: Freed up vertical space for transcription and other main content

**Features Added**:
- Settings button with tooltip in header
- Popover component with improved styling
- Device count chip showing available microphones
- Active device highlighting with colored icon and "Active" chip
- Close button for easy popup dismissal
- Responsive positioning and mobile-friendly design

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/src/pages/MeetingRoom.tsx`: Removed old settings section, added popup implementation with enhanced features

**User Experience Benefits**:
- **Cleaner Interface**: Main meeting room interface is less cluttered
- **Better Mobile Experience**: Popup works better on smaller screens
- **Improved Workflow**: Settings accessible but not intrusive
- **Enhanced Visual Design**: Modern popup with better styling
- **Space Efficiency**: More room for transcription and other content

# Audio Settings Popup Test Plan

## New Feature: Audio Settings Popup

The Audio Settings have been moved from a dedicated section to a popup window accessible from the top right corner of the meeting room.

## Changes Made

### 1. UI Layout Changes
- **Removed**: Large Audio Settings section that took up vertical space
- **Added**: Settings icon button in top right corner of header
- **Added**: Popup window (Popover) that appears when settings button is clicked

### 2. Enhanced Functionality
- **Tooltip**: Hover over settings button shows "Audio Settings" tooltip
- **Close Button**: X button in top right of popup to close
- **Device Count**: Shows number of available audio devices
- **Active Device**: Highlights currently selected device with "Active" chip
- **Visual Indicators**: Selected device has colored microphone icon

### 3. Improved UX
- **Space Saving**: Removes clutter from main interface
- **On-Demand Access**: Settings only visible when needed
- **Better Organization**: Clean, focused popup interface

## Testing Steps

### 1. Visual Verification
1. **Navigate** to meeting room (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/meeting/1`)
2. **Check Header**: Verify settings button appears in top right corner
3. **Button Style**: Should be blue circular button with settings icon
4. **Tooltip**: Hover over button should show "Audio Settings" tooltip

### 2. Popup Functionality
1. **Click Settings Button**: Popup should appear below and to the right
2. **Popup Content**: Should show:
   - "Audio Settings" title with close button
   - Description text about microphone selection
   - Device count chip (e.g., "2 devices available")
   - Dropdown with available audio devices
3. **Close Popup**: Click X button or click outside popup

### 3. Device Selection
1. **Open Dropdown**: Click on "Audio Input Device" dropdown
2. **Device List**: Should show all available microphones
3. **Active Device**: Currently selected device should have:
   - Blue microphone icon
   - "Active" green chip
4. **Change Device**: Select different device and verify it becomes active

### 4. Responsive Behavior
1. **Different Screen Sizes**: Test on various screen widths
2. **Popup Position**: Should always appear properly positioned
3. **Mobile**: Test on mobile devices if applicable

## Expected UI Improvements

### Before (Old Design):
- Audio Settings took up full width section
- Always visible, taking vertical space
- Basic dropdown without visual indicators

### After (New Design):
- Clean header with settings button
- Popup only appears when needed
- Enhanced device selection with visual feedback
- More space for main content

## Success Criteria

✅ **Test Passes If**:
